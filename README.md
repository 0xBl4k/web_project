# PHASE2
This part serves as a comprehensive guide for phase2. It outlines the description, requirements, and
important instructions of phase 2.

## Phase2 consists of the following:
• Bootstrap:

    - Ensure that your website is fully responsive by employing Bootstrap, which allows it to
    adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a uniform user experience
    (the grid system must be included and understood in all pages).

    - Add at least one concept of the discussed bootstrap component to your website, e.g.
    carousel, cards, accordion ...etc.

    - The navigation menu must be implemented using bootstrap.



• JavaScript: Detailed requirements for JavaScript are provided below.

## JavaScript
Create a validation and calculation form in JavaScript that allows you to define custom validation
rules and messages. You are required to be creative and customize the form to align with your
**project's concept, objectives, and specific needs**, ensuring that it adds significant value to your
project.


## Project Specific Needs:
1. Create an HTML Form: **Design a new webpage that includes a straightforward HTML form.**
This form should include input fields for details along with options for radio buttons, checkboxes,
and textarea. **Incorporate a link to this form in your website's navigation menu.**

2. Date and Time: Add date and time on top of the form web page.

3. Validation: Implement **JavaScript validation for all fields**, ensuring they meet specific criteria you
have chosen. Write JavaScript functions to validate each field (e.g., numbers are within the
ranges, text fields are not empty and validate that at least one checkbox or radio button is selected).

4. Error Messages: **Display error messages with each field** if the validation fails, guiding them toward
accurate input **using span**.

5. Calculations and recommendations: **Perform calculations** based on the project's concept you have
selected and **based on the result of the calculations provide recommendations to the user**.

6. Report Writing: Ensure that all values and calculations are included in a **report displayed within the textarea** if they meet the validation criteria.
